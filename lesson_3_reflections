When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I am working collaboratorily, or have something to share withe world, make a breakthrough or require assistance on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It gives me control over what to commit and when.
